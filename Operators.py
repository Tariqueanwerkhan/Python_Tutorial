# operators
#1. Arithmetic Operator
# a = 5
# b = 3
# print(a+b)
# print(a-b)
# print(a*b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a%b)

#2. comparison operators  --- output will be boolean
# a = 5
# b = 3
# print(a>b)
# print(a<b)
# print(a==b)
# print(a!=b)

#3. Assignment operators
# a = 5

#4. Logical operators
# a = 10
# b = 20
# print(a>10 and b<20)
# print(a==10 and b==20)
# print(a==10 or b<10)
# # not operator
# print(not(a==10 and b==20))

#5. Identity operator
# x = [1,2,3]
# y = x
# z = [1,2,3]
# print(x is y)     # is operator
# print(x is z)
# print(x is not y)      # is not operator
# print(x is not z)


#6. Membership operators   -- in, not in
# my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
# print('watermelon' not in my_list)
# print('apple' in my_list)


#7. Bitwise operator
a = 5            # 5 in binary- 0101
b = 3            # 3 in binary- 0011
print(a & b)                  # 0001
print(a | b)                  # 0111
